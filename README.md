# Big Data Science and Analytics Platforms Class
Hi, this is my website for the BDA class at SDSU. I am a German exchange student interested in using big data in healtcare.

## Data Repository
A repository of datasets I really like is the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). I like that it contains various different datasets. Many of them include medical data. This data can be used to predict diseases, track their progession, and even to find possible drugs. An example is the [heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). It contains 14 features. These features can help to predict heart disease as early as possible and hopefully save lives. 

One important part of big data is bringing together data of various sources and types. This is why I like the UCI repository. It contains data from a lot of different sources. Integration different data types is currently a widely researched topic. Often the term _multimodal machine learning_ is used for this. I believe that we can better leverage existing data by bringing together all information we have.

## Data Sciece Book
One of my favorite books about data science is the [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. It explains the fundations of Deep Learning. Especially, since the rise of Large Language Models, I think that everyone is aware that Deep Learning models will play a large role in our lives in the future. Therefore, this book provides an introduction about Deep Learning models. Furthermore, more advanced topics as well as neural network architectures are addressed. The book was published in 2016 by MIT Press.
